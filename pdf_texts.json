For a society to be organized, it needs a well-financed administrative structure. \nTherefore, taxation in its different forms has existed as long as society had the \nminimum elements of government.\nTax is a monetary charge imposed by the government on persons, entities, transactions \nor property to generate government revenue. Where payment is not monetary, a wider \nembracing definition has been adopted as:\n“Enforced proportional contributions from persons and property levied by the State \nby virtue of its sovereignty for the support of government and for all public needs”\n- Thomas. M. Cooley: The Law of Taxation\nOne of the main characteristics of a tax is that the payer does not demand something \nin return equivalent to the payment made to government. Taxes are collected and \nused by government for a public good and not just for those who make the payment.\n2.0 History of Taxation in East Africa\nTaxation was introduced in East Africa by the early British colonial administrators \nthrough the system of compulsory public works such as road construction, building \nof administrative headquarters and schools, as well as forest clearance and other \nsimilar works.\nThe first formal tax, the hut tax, was introduced in 1900. This is when the first common \ntariff arrangements were established between Kenya and Uganda. Through this, \nUgandans started paying customs duty as an indirect tax, which involved imposition \nof an ad valorem import duty at a rate of 5% on all goods entering East Africa, through \nthe port of Mombasa and destined for Uganda.\nA similar arrangement was subsequently made with German East Africa (Tanganyika) \nfor goods destined for Uganda that entered East Africa through Dar-es- Salaam and \nTanga ports. This gave rise to revenue which was remitted to Uganda.2.0 | History of Taxation in East Africa1.0 | Background to TaxatonBackground to Taxation12  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth EditionThe Protectorate government heavily relied on customs duties to fund its programs. \nMost indigenous Africans were not engaging in activities that would propel the \ngrowth of the monetary economy. Accordingly, government introduced a flat rate \nPoll tax that was imposed on all male adults. The requirement to pay tax forced the \nindigenous Ugandans to enter the market sector of the economy through either \nselling their agricultural produce or hiring out their services. The tax burden was later \nincreased by the introduction of an additional tax to finance local governments. This \nculminated into the first tax legislation in 1919 under the Local Authorities’ Ordinance. \nIn 1953, following recommendations by a committee headed by Mr. C.A.G Wallis, \nGraduated personal tax was introduced to finance local governments.\nIncome tax was introduced in Uganda in 1940 by a Protectorate ordinance. It was \nmainly payable by the Europeans and Asians but was later on extended to Africans. \nIn 1952, the ordinances were replaced by the East African Income Tax Management \nAct, which laid down the basic legal provisions found in the current income tax law. \nThe East African Income Tax Management Act of 1952 was repealed and replaced \nby the East African Income Tax Management Act of 1958.\nThe administration of both income tax and customs duty was done by departments \nof the East African Community (EAC) until its collapse. Under the EAC dispensation, \nthere were regional taxing statutes and uniform administration but the national gov -\nernments (or partner states, as they were called) retained the right to define tax rates.\nAfter the collapse of the EAC, the tax departments were transferred to Ministry of \nFinance with the transfer of the Income Tax Department in 1974; followed by the Cus -\ntoms Department in 1977. In 1991, the function of administering Central government \ntaxes was shifted from the Ministry of Finance to the Uganda Revenue Authority, a \ncorporate body established by an Act of Parliament.\nThe EAC was re-established in 1999 by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Rwanda and \nBurundi joined the EAC in 2007. The EAC in December 2004 enacted the East African \nCommunity Customs Management Act 2004 (EAC-CMA).\nThis Act governs the administration of the EA Customs union, including the legal, \nadministrative issues and operations.\n3.0 The Legality of Taxes collected by the Central Government\nArticles 152 (1) of the Uganda Constitution provides that “No tax shall be imposed \nexcept under the authority of an Act of Parliament”. Therefore, the Uganda Revenue \nAuthority Act. 3.0 | The Legality of Taxes collected by the Central GovernmentBackground to Taxation13  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth EditionCap 196 was put in place to provide the administrative framework in which taxes \nunder various Acts are collected.\nUganda Revenue Authority administers the tax laws (Acts) on behalf of the Ministry \nof Finance, Planning and Economic Development under the following legislations:\ni. Customs Tariff Act. Cap 337.\nii. East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004 \niii. East African Excise Management Act Cap 28\niv. Excise Tariff Act Cap 338\nv. Income Tax Act Cap 340\nvi. Stamp Duty Act Cap 342\nvii. The Finance Acts \nviii. The Gaming and Pool Betting (Control and Taxation) Act Cap 292\nix. The Tax Procedures Code Act, 2014\nx. Traffic and Road Safety Act Cap 361\nxi. Value Added Tax Act Cap 349\nxii. All other taxes and non-tax revenue as the Minister responsible for   \nFinance may prescribe.\n4.0 Principles of Taxation\nThe principles of taxation are concepts that provide for guidelines towards a good \ntax system. Since many view taxation as a necessary evil, it should be administered \nin a way that creates minimum pain to the payer, just like the proverbial honey bee \nwhich collects nectar from the flower without hurting the flower.\nEconomists over time have laid down the principles that policy makers should take \ninto account when making tax laws; these principles are referred to as the canons \nof taxation.\nThe following are the common canons of taxation:\n4.1 Equity/Fairness\nTax should be levied fairly so that:\n(i) The same amount of tax is paid by persons or entities that are \n  equal in earnings or wealth (horizontal equity).\nIllustration\nIf B is a shopkeeper and makes a profit of Shs 10,000,000 in a year and is taxed at \n10%, which is equal to Shs 1,000,000, and C who is a cattle trader makes a profit of \nShs 10,000,000 in a year, he should also be taxed at 10%. Likewise, any other person \nwho earns an income of Shs 10, 000,000, should pay the same tax. 4.0  |  Principles of TaxationBackground to Taxation14  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition(ii) The contribution in tax should increase as the taxable income increases \n(vertical equity). The principle behind vertical equity, which is most applicable \nin income taxes, is that the burden among taxpayers should be distributed fairly, \ntaking into account individual income and personal circumstances. Vertical equity \nis to be taxed proportionate to the income one earns. The strongest shoulders \nshould carry the heaviest burden.\nIllustration\nB and C in illustration 1 were taxed at 10% because they both earned 10,000,000; if \nD earned Shs 15,000,000 this person may be taxed at 15%.\n4.2 Convenience\nUnder normal circumstances, a taxpayer should not undergo undue difficulty to pay \ntax. Therefore, the place, medium, mode, manner and time of payment should not \nbe a burden to the taxpayer.\nIllustration\nA person doing business in Tororo should not be inconvenienced to travel to Kampala \nto pay his/her taxes. An office should be created nearby to ease the process.\n4.3 Certainty\nA good tax system is one where the taxes are well understood by both tax payers \nand tax collectors. The time and reason of payment as well as the amount to be paid \nby an individual should be well documented and certain or known. The tax should \nbe based on laws passed by parliament.\n4.4 Economical\nThe administrative cost of collecting taxes should be kept as low as possible to \nboth the collecting agent and the taxpayer. The general principle is that the cost of \ncollection and administration of taxes to the collecting agent should not exceed 5% \nof the tax revenue. Likewise, the cost of compliance to the taxpayer should be as low \nas possible and must not be seen to hinder voluntary compliance.\nIllustration\nURA collected about shillings 16Tn in the financial year 2018/19. By the principle of \nEconomy; the cost of collecting and administrating taxes should not exceed 5% of \nshillings 16Tn.Background to Taxation15  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition4.5 Simplicity\nThe type of tax and the method of assessment and collection must be simple enough \nto be understood by both the taxpayers and the collectors. Complicated taxes lead to \ndisputes, delays, corruption, avoidance and high costs of collection in terms of time \nand resources.\n4.6 Ability to Pay\nThe tax levied should not exceed the taxable income of a person. This is to avoid \ndiscouraging the person’s performance or participation in the tax base.\nOther canons of taxation include; Diversity, Productivity, and Elasticity.\n5.0 Characteristics of a good Tax System\nIn complying with the canons of taxation, taxes are characterized as proportional, \nprogressive or regressive.\n5.1 Progressive Tax\nThis tax is structured in such a way that the tax rate increases as the person’s income \nincreases. Most income taxes are progressive so that higher incomes are taxed at a \nhigher rate. A progressive tax is based on the principle of vertical equity.\n5.2 Regressive Tax\nThis is a tax not based on the ability to pay. A regressive tax is structured that the effective \ntax decreases as the income increases.\n5.3 Proportional Tax\nThis is a tax whose rate remains fixed regardless of the amount of the tax base. A \nproportional tax may be considered regressive despite its constant rate when it is more \nburdensome for low income payers than to high income payers.\n6.0 Classification of Taxes\nTaxes are classified as either direct or indirect.\nDirect Taxes are imposed directly on a person’s income arising from business, 6.0  |  Classification of Taxes5.0  |  Characteristics of a good Tax System Background to Taxation16  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Editionemployment, property and the burden of the tax is borne by the individual or business \nentity. Examples of direct taxes include Corporation tax, Presumptive (Small business) \ntax, Individual Income Tax, such as Pay As You Earn, capital gains tax and rental income \ntax.\nIndirect Taxes are taxes levied on consumption of goods and services. The taxes are \ncollected by an agent and some of them include Value Added Taxes (VAT), excise duty, \nimport duty among others.\nIllustration\nShopkeeper B sells bread to K for Shs 2,000, on which VAT has been charged. The VAT \non the bread therefore is Shs 305 (18% of 2,000). The tax is remitted to the Government \nby the seller. Although K has paid the Shs 305 on bread that was priced at Shs 1,695, \nthe tax is accounted to URA by B and K need not follow up the transaction with URA.\n \n 7.0 Role of Taxation\na) To finance Government re-current and development expenditure, i.e. paying  \n salaries for civil servants and funding long term projects such as construction of  \n schools, hospitals and roads.\nb) It can be used to regulate demand and supply in the economy in times of inflation.\nc) It encourages development of local industries with a view to providing   \n employment and saving foreign exchange, by imposing high duties on competing  \n imports. It encourages export of goods and services by reducing or removing  \n tax on the export in order to make them more competitive in the world market.\nd) It protects society from undesirable or harmful products and industries by  \n imposing high taxes on them, for instance excise duty on cigarettes and beer as  \n well as environmental levy on used vehicles.\ne) To achieve greater equality in the distribution of wealth and income, the   \n government may impose a progressive tax on the incomes and wealth of the rich.  \n The revenue raised is then used to provide social services for the benefit of the  \n society. 7.0  |  Role of TaxationBackground to Taxation17  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition8.0 About Uganda Revenue Authority\nUganda Revenue Authority (URA) is a Statutory Authority established by the Uganda \nRevenue Authority Act, Cap 196 with the mandate of assessment, collection and \nadministration of taxes, fees and Non- Tax revenue in Uganda. \n8.1 Vision\nA transformational Revenue Service for Uganda’s Economic Independence\n8.2 Mission\nMobilize revenue for National Development in a Transparent and Efficient manner.\n8.3 Core Values\n• Patriotism \n• Integrity \n• Professionalism\n8.4 Client Value Proposition\nWe promise excellent revenue services everywhere, all the time at the lowest cost \npossible.\n8.5 Tagline\nDeveloping Uganda Together\n8.6 How URA is organized to serve its clients\nUganda Revenue Authority is administered by a Board of Directors, which is the policy \nmaking body entrusted with general oversight of the organisation.

The Taxpayers charter is therefore a set of guidelines that guarantees \na meaningful relationship between URA and its various stakeholders.Background to Taxation24  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition8.15.1 Rights of the Taxpayer\na) Right to fair treatment\nTaxpayers have a right to be treated fairly in all their dealings with URA.

Besides registration, the taxpayer \nis able to amend his / her registration details with URA in case of any changes. \nTaxpayer will always receive feedbacks on the application and this is possible \nespecially when accurate email addresses and telephone numbers (of the taxpayers) \nare indicated in the application.\n9.2 E – Filing\nA taxpayer registered with URA for any tax type other than PAYE has an obligation to \nsubmit a return for the tax period defined by the respective tax law. URA facilitated \nthe taxpayer to fulfill this obligation by introducing electronic filing in eTAX.\nThe taxpayer obtains a return from the web portal (http:/ / ura.go.ug), save a template \non any storage devise, take time to fill in the return and validate the return before \nthey finally upload it on the web portal. If the upload is successful, the taxpayer \nwill receive an auto generated e-acknowledgement receipt which is evidence of \nsubmission. In case of any problems in filling the respective returns, do not hesitate \nto send an email about the challenge to URA on the email address; services@ura.\ngo.ug or call the toll free lines.\n \nIn case there are errors in the return detected by the system, the taxpayer is given a \nchance to amend the errors when he/she is issued a Return Modified Advice Notice.\nThe return must be submitted by the due date to avoid penalties for late filing and \nit must also be submitted for each tax period to avoid estimated assessments that \narise out of non-submission of returns. In case the taxpayer is unable to submit a \nreturn on time, he or she can apply for the extension of time to submit a return late \nusing an application form for late filing also found on the web portal.\nSome of the benefits accruing from e-filing are that the return process was clearly \nseparated from the payment process and the taxpayer can now file returns before/ \nafter making the payment, or make the payment before/ after filing the return.\nNB:  Both Payment and Return should be made on or before the deadline.\n9.3 E – Payment\nA taxpayer required to make payments to URA for any tax type can do so using the \ne payment process. All the taxpayer needs to do is to go onto the URA web portal \n(http:/ /ura. go.ug), access the payment registration slip, register the payment and \ngo to the bank to make the actual payment over the counter. The taxpayer in future Background to Taxation28  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Editionmay even not need to go to the bank as such facilities like, mobile money, Payway, \nVISA Cards are enabled for use \nBenefits accruing from e-payment are that the taxpayer can utilize the service on \na 24-hour basis, the taxpayer’s costs of movement between his/her premises and \nURA or the bank are reduced; and thus saving time. Taxpayers can also monitor the \nstatus of their payments online through the web portal.\n10.0 Definition of Key Terms\nA Person  - Includes an individual, a partnership, a trust, a company, a retirement \nfund, a government, a political subdivision of government, and a listed institution.\nChargeable Income - is the gross income of a person for the year less total \ndeductions allowed under the Income Tax Act Cap 340 for the year.\nGross Income of a person for a year of income  - is the total amount of business \nincome, employment income and property income other than exempt income. In \ncase of resident persons, Gross income is a person’s income from all geographical \nsources; and in the case of non-resident persons, gross income includes only the \nincome derived from Uganda.\nResidency for tax purposes  is defined in relation to individual, partnership and \nCompany as follows:\nA resident individual  is a person who has a permanent home in Uganda; or is present \nin Uganda: for a period of 183 days or more in any twelve (12) months period that \ncommences or ends during the year of income; or during the year of income and in \neach of the two preceding years of income, for periods averaging 122 days in each \nsuch year of income; or is an employee or official of the government of Uganda \nposted abroad during the year of income.\nA resident company is one which:\n a) Is incorporated in Uganda under the laws of Uganda\n b) Is managed or controlled in Uganda at any time during \n  the year of income.\n c) Undertakes a majority of its operations in Uganda during \n  the year of income.\nA resident partnership  - is one where any of the partners was a resident person in 10.0  |  Definition of key termsBackground to Taxation29  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition12.1  Business Income\nBusiness is defined in the Income Tax Act to include any trade, profession, vocation \nor adventure in the nature of trade.\nBusiness income means any income derived by a person in carrying on a business \nand includes the following amounts, whether of a revenue or\ncapital nature:\n• The amount of Gains or losses from the disposal of business assets such as land \nand buildings.The scope of liability to tax depends on a person’s residence status.\nIncome tax is imposed on Income from business, employment and property.\nFor a resident person, income tax is charged on gross income from all over the world \nwhile for a non- resident person is only charged on income derived from sources \nwithin Uganda.\nIncome tax is charged on every person who has chargeable income for each year of \nincome. Chargeable income is derived from three main sources of income, namely; \nbusiness, employment and property.\nIncome tax is administered under the Income Tax Act (1997) Cap 340 on chargeable \nincome. As earlier noted, chargeable income is the gross income of a person for \nthe of income less total deductions allowed under the income tax act.\n 12.0  |  Sources of incomeUganda during the year of income.\nYear of Income  - means the period of twelve months ending on June 30, and includes \na substituted year of income and a transitional year of income.\nA substituted year of income  - is a period of 12 months ending on a date other than \nJune 30.\nA transitional year of income  - is a period of less than 12 months that falls between \nthe person’s previous accounting date and a new accounting date. This results from a \nchange in a person’s accounting date.\n11.0  |  Scope of Tax LiabilityBackground to Taxation30  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition• Any amount derived by a person as consideration for accepting a restriction  \n on the person’s capacity to carry on business.\n For example,  if Mama Rhoda gives Senkubuge Shs 100,000 to relocate his  \n shop to another area, the Shs 100,000 becomes business income to Senkubuge.\n• The gross proceeds derived by a person from the disposal of trading stock,  \n i.e. sales.\n• The value of any gifts derived by a person in the course of, or by virtue of, a  \n past, present, or prospective business relationship.\n• Interest derived by a person in respect of trade receivables or by a person  \n engaged in the business of banking or money lending.\n• Rent derived by a person whose business is wholly or mainly the holding or  \n letting of property.\nThe definition of business is therefore inclusive rather than specific such that there \ncan be business which does not arise from trade, profession vocation or adventure \nin the nature of trade.\n12.1.1  Trade\nTrade has the same meaning as commerce and it involves buying and selling or \nbartering of goods. There are many exceptions to this general definition but the \nfollowing elements are crosscutting:\n• The element of profit\n• The regularity of the transactions.\n• The arrangements and effort, and,\n• Compliance with statutory obligations made to make the transactions   \n work.\nAny of the above may determine whether a trade is carried out. However, depending \non the facts of each case, the existence of these conditions could generally lead \nto the likelihood of a trade.\n12.1.2 Adventure in the Nature of Trade\nThis refers to transactions where profits arise from activities such as gambling, \nspeculative dealings in commodities, single or one off transactions or unconventional \ntransaction e.g. smuggling.\nThe definition of an adventure of trade may appear sometimes to overlap with \ntrade, but if either is proved, the requirements for business definition are satisfied.\nThe following characteristics may point to an adventure in the nature of trade.\n• Profit seeking.Background to Taxation31  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition• The way in which the asset was acquired.\n• The nature of the asset.\n• Modification of the asset prior to sale or use.\n• Interval between purchase and sale of the asset.\n• Way in which the sale is effected.\n• Number of transactions.\n• Existence of trading interest in the same field.\n• Method of financing the transaction.\n12.1.3 Profession\nThis is a paid occupation especially one which requires advanced \neducation and training, e.g. architecture, accounting, law and medicine. \nThis is how one passes one’s life when earning a living. More often, it is referred to \nas a special calling and qualification for a certain kind of work especially for social or \nreligious work. It can thus be used to bring within the scope of income tax any form \nof regular and continuous profit earning, which does not fall within the categories \nof trade, business, profession or employment. Earnings from activities related to \nreligion can fall in this category.\nBusiness income is considered if it is ‘derived’ during the year of income. ‘Derive’ \nhas been judicially determined to be equivalent to ‘accrue’ or ‘arising’, which also \nrelates to the source of income.\n12.1.4 Capital Gains\nCapital gains arise from the disposal of a business asset that is not a depreciable \nasset, such as land and buildings. A disposal of an asset occurs when an asset has \nbeen sold, exchanged, redeemed, distributed, transferred by way of gift, destroyed \nor lost by the taxpayer. The Capital gain is the excess of the consideration over the \ncost base of the asset. Conversely, there may also be a loss when the cost base of \nthe asset is higher than the consideration received for the business asset.\nCost base of an asset is the amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the \nasset, including incidental expenditures of a capital nature incurred in acquiring the \nasset, and includes the market value at the date of acquisition of any consideration \nin kind given for the asset.\nCapital gains are included in the gross income of the taxpayer and assessed as a \nbusiness income.Background to Taxation32  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth EditionCalculation of capital gains tax\nIn the calculation of capital gains tax, indexation is provided for in order to account \nfor inflation. This means that before determining Capital Gains tax on a business \nasset, one will factor in inflation among others that influence the asset value. However, \nindexation only applies where the asset is sold after 12 months from the date of \npurchase of that Asset.\nThe prescribed formula is: \nCB x CPID/CPIA, where;\nCB is the amount of an item of cost or expense incurred;\nCPID is the Consumer Price Index number published for the calendar month of \nsale; and\nCPIA is the Consumer Price Index number published for the month immediately \nprior to the date on which the relevant item of cost or expense was incurred.\nIllustration:\nA piece of land was purchased in June 2015 for shs.10, 000,000 and sold in January \n2016 for shs.25, 000,000. The Consumer Price Index for 2015 is 153.25 and for 2016 \nis 181.67\nIn this case, the indexed cost of acquisition would be\n10,000,000 x 181.67/153.25 = 11,854,486\nWhere CB=10,000,000 \nCPID=181.67\nCPIA=153.25\nSo, the taxable capital gain would be 25,000,000 – 11,854,486 = 13,145,514 \nAnd tax at 30% would be Shs.3, 943,654.\nIf the land was purchased and sold within 12 months from the date of the purchase, \nthe capital gains would be computed by deducting the original purchase price (cost \nbase) from the selling price.\nSo, the taxable capital gain would be 25,000,000 – 10,000,000 = 15,000,000 and \ntax at 30% would be Shs.4, 500,000.\nTherefore, indexation creates a tax saving of shs.556, 346.\n12.2 Employment Income\nAny income derived by an employee from any employment, whether past, present \nor in future, including the value of any benefit, advantage or facility granted to \nan employee constitutes employment Income. An amount or benefit is derived Background to Taxation33  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Editionin respect of employment if it is provided in respect of past, present or prospective \nemployment. It also includes an amount or benefit provided by a third party under an \narrangement with an employer or an associate of the employer; and it does not matter \nwhether it is paid to the employee or to his associates.\nEmployment is regarded to exist where there is a contractual relationship between \nmaster and a servant for a pay.\nEmployment refers to:\n• Position of an individual in employment of another person.\n• Directorship of a company.\n• A position entitling the holder to a fixed or ascertainable remuneration.\n• Holding or acting in a public office.\nIt is important to distinguish between an employee and an independent \ncontractor. As a general rule, an individual who does not satisfy the \ndefinition above automatically becomes an independent contractor.  \nFactors to consider when distinguishing between employees and contractors  \n• Who has control over hours of work?\n• Who has control over location of place of work?\n• Who has control over sequence of work?\n• Who furnishes the tools, equipment and materials?\n• Whether the work has a risk of profit or loss?\nAn employer means a person (individual or corporate) whoemploys/remunerates \nan individual while an employee is an individual engaged in employment\n12.2.1 Composition of Employment Income  \nAccording to the Income tax Act cap 340, Employment income includes: \n• Wages, salary, leave pay, payment in lieu of leave, overtime pay, fees,   \n commission, gratuity, bonus, allowances (entertainment, duty, utility, welfare,  \n housing, medical, or any other allowances)\n• The value of any benefits in kind provided by/on behalf of the employer to  \n the employee\n• Amount of private/personal expenditure discharged or reimbursed by the  \n employer\n• Employment terminal and retirement benefits\n• Insurance premiums paid by the employer for the employee and/or his  \n dependants\n• Payments in respect of change of employment/contract termsBackground to Taxation34  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition• Discounts in shares allotted to an employee and any gain derived on   \n disposal of a right or option to acquire shares under an employee share  \n acquisition scheme\nNote : It should be noted that all or any of the above in combination  \n comprise employment income.\n12.2.2 Benefits in Kind \nA benefit in kind is the facilitation not by way of cash by an employer to an employee \nas part of past, present or future employment terms. Such benefits need not have \nbeen in the written employment terms. Taxable non-cash employment benefits \ninclude:\n• Private use of an official motor vehicle\n• Provision of domestic servants and utilities\n• Meals, refreshment, entertainment\n• Relief of debt obligations/interest\n• Provision of property by employer to employee (at no arm’s length terms)\n• Provision of residential accommodation\n• Any other benefits as determined by the Commissioner General.\n12.2.3 Valuation of Benefits in Kind \nAs a general rule, the value of a benefit in kind is the fair market value of the benefit \non the date it is taken into account for tax purposes less any amount paid by the \nemployee for the benefit. \n1. Motor Vehicle – Where a benefit provided by an employer to an  employee \nconsists of the use or availability for use of a motor vehicle wholly or partly for the \nprivate purposes of the employee, the value of the benefit is calculated according \nto the following formula: (20% × A × B/C) – D where, \nA is the market value of the motor vehicle at the time when it was first provided for \nthe private use of the employee. \nB is the number of days in the year of income in which the motor vehicle was used \nor available for use for private purposes by the employee for all or a part of the day. \nC is the number of days in the year of income\nD is any payment made by the employee for the benefit\n2. Domestic Assistants  (housekeeper, driver, gardener or other domestic \nassistant) – The benefit is the total employment income paid to the domestic \nassistants, reduced by any payment made by the employee for the benefit.\n3.

Background to Taxation35  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition4. Utilities (Electricity, Water, Telephone, Internet) –  The benefit is the cost of \nthe utility to the employer less any payment by the employee. \n5. Low interest on loans exceeding one million shillings –  The benefit is the \ndifference between the interest paid by the employee and the inteerest payable \nusing the statutory interest rate (Bank of Uganda discount rate at commencement \nof the year of Income). \n6. Debt waiver –  The benefit is the amount of the debt waived.\n7. Transfer or use of property or provision of services (Furniture and \ntransportation) –  The benefit is the market value of the property or services less \nany payments by the employee.\n8. Accommodation or housing other than by way of reimbursement, discharges \nor allowances –  Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists \nof the provision of accommodation or housing, the value of the benefit in kind is \nthe lesser of:\n(a) the market rent of the accommodation or housing\n(b) reduced by any payment made by the employee for the benefit; or (b)   \n15% of the employment income, including the amount referred to in   \nparagraph (a), paid by the employer to the employee for the year of income in which \nthe accommodation or housing was provided.\n9. Any other benefit – The benefit is the market value of the benefit  less any \npayments by the employee.\n12.2.4 Employee’s Relief \nThis refers to gains or income that is not included in the chargeable income of the \nemployee and therefore not taxable on the employee: \na. The employee’s income that is below the taxable threshold, currently at Shs  \n 235,000 per month \nb. Pension\nc.

However, if rent is \nderived by the person whose business is not wholly or mainly the holding or letting \nof property, then it is classified under property income. For example if a company \nreceives rent from its properties, then it is classified as property income because it \nis not in the business of holding or letting of property.\n12.4 Exempt Income \nCertain incomes by law are not taxed and they are referred to as exempt income. \nExempt income is listed in section 21 of the Income Tax Act.Background to Taxation37  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition\nPART B\nDOMESTIC TAXESBackground to Taxation38  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition\nSKIP THE  QUEUE\nWhatsApp: (256) 772 - 140000Get your free TIN now via \nwww.ura.go.ug“URA has unveiled a simpler \n TIN registration process”Domestic Taxes39  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition\nURA, through its modernization process improved the registration process through \nproviding online services on a 24-hour basis.

Where the expenditure \nis only partly incurred in the production of income included in the gross income, the \nIncome Tax Act provides for apportionment such that the deduction allowed is only to \nthe extent to which it was so incurred. \nAccordingly, the general features of deductions are: \na) There must be an expenditure or loss \nb) The expenditure or loss must be incurred by a person during the year   \n of income\nc) The expenditure or loss must be incurred in the production of income   \nincluded in gross income.\nThe Income Tax Act lists, under sections 22 – 38, a number of expenditures and loses \nthat are allowable deductions. For instance, Interests, bad debts, repairs, depreciation, \ninitial allowances, startup costs, meals, etc. Capital expenditure e.g. purchase of a motor \nvehicle is not in itself an allowable deduction but it is allowed capital deduction for its \ndepreciation. Likewise all depreciable assets are allowed a deduction as specified in the \nSixth schedule of the Income tax Act. \nCapital allowances are thus treated as operating expenses and deducted in arriving \nat chargeable income or profits chargeable to tax. Deductions allowed on capital \nexpenditure include the following categories: \n1. Depreciable assets — varies as per 6th Schedule of the Act \n2. Industrial building — 5% straight line depreciation allowance \n3. Startup costs — 25% per year for four years \n4. Costs of intangible assets — actual cost \n5.

The \npreparation of these accounts would usually require engagement of a professional \naccountant which is costly. In order to address this challenge, the Income Tax Act \nprovides for an arrangement of taxing small businesses based on gross turnover or \ntotal sales. This is commonly referred to as presumptive tax.\n7.1.1  Who is a Small Business Taxpayer?\nFor income tax purposes, a small business taxpayer is a resident taxpayer whose gross \nturnover from all businesses owned by such a person in a year is more than five million \nshillings but does not exceed ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SHILLINGS. The term \nTURNOVER refers to one’s total sales in a year.

The person liable is the receiver of the imported service.\n7.7.3 VAT Registration\nVAT registration is the process of getting eligible persons put or recorded on the VAT \nRegister. Two key terms are normally applied in VAT registration ie\n• VAT Threshold: This refers to the minimum level of taxable turnover above \nwhich a person is required to register for VAT. The current annual threshold is \nShs.150million. However for registration purposes, this is determined on a quarterly \nbasis currently being Shs. 37.5 million in any three consecutive calendar months\n• Turnover: This is the total value of taxable sales of both goods and   \nservices.\n7.7.4 Persons required/eligible to register for VAT \nRegistration for VAT can be done either compulsorily or voluntarily.\n7.7.4.1 Compulsory Registration\nThere are two categories of persons that are required to compulsorily register for \nVAT under the VAT Act. These are:\n• Persons who make taxable supplies (turnover) in excess of 37.5 million in any 3 \nconsecutive calendar months.\n• Public bodies that engage in business activities.

These bodies should apply for registration \non the date they start dealing in business activities. The business activities include \nhall hire, tendering of services, markets, street parking, toilet management \nservices, street bill board adverts and disposal of assets, among others.Domestic Taxes74  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fourth Edition7.7.4.2 Voluntary Registration\nPersons whose taxable turnover is below the VAT threshold are eligible to register if \nthey wish to do so provided they meet the following general requirements\n• The applicant must have a fixed place of abode or business.\n• The applicant should be able to keep proper books of accounts.\n• The applicant should be able to submit regular and reliable tax returns.\n• The applicant should be a fit and a proper person in the opinion of the \nCommissioner\n7.7.5 VAT Registration Processes\n7.7.5.1  Application for Registration\nUnder compulsory basis\n• Historical test: A Person who makes taxable supplies that exceed the VAT \nthreshold is required to register for VAT. The person shall apply to register within \n20 days after a period of three consecutive calendar months if in that period the \nperson’s taxable supplies exceeded a quarter of the annual threshold (currently \nShs. 37.5 million). For example, if one’s taxable sales in the months of July to \nSeptember 2019 exceed Shs. 3 7. 5 million, that person must apply for registration \nin the first 20 days of October 2019.\n• Future test: Where a person expects to make taxable supplies of more than a \nquarter of the annual threshold (Shs.37.5 million) in the next three months, that \nperson is required to apply for registration at the beginning of that period of \nthe projected three consecutive calendar months. This is especially common \nwith contractual jobs where one would be certain of what to earn and when. \nFor example if at the beginning of October one projects that he/she will make \ntaxable sales over shs.37,500,000 in the next three months (from October 2019 \nto December 2019), then that person is required to apply for registration on 1st \nOctober 2019.\nFurthermore, in case the Commissioner General finds reasonable grounds to believe \nthat the person is required to apply to registration but has failed to register, he/she \nshall register such person and registration shall take effect as he/she deems.\nCompulsory registration for Public Bodies\nPublic Bodies should apply for registration on the date they start engaging in any \nbusiness activity.\nApplication under Voluntary RegistrationDomestic Taxes75  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth EditionThe date of application is as per the taxpayer’s choice.\n7.7.6  Inspection / Notification\nThis exercise is conducted to confirm the correctness of the information provided in \nthe application form by the taxpayer.

For instance, if due date to apply for registration fell in the month of April 2019, \neffective date of registration would be 1st May 2019.\nIn the case of voluntary registration, the effective date of registration is the first day \nof the month following the month in which the application was made. For instance, \nif the application was in the month of January, 2015, effective date of registration \nwould be 1st Feb. 2015.\n7.7.8 VAT Registration entitlements\nUpon being registered the person will be entitled to Input tax credit on both capital \ngoods and trading stock at hand on the effective date of registration provided they \nwere purchased not more than six months prior to effective date of registration \nexcept for the case of manufacturers where the period was extended to 12 months \neffective 1st July 2020.\n7.7.9  Penalty for late registration\nA person who fails to apply for registration by the due date is liable to a penalty of \ndouble the tax due from the date the person ought to have been registered to when \nhe is registered.\n7.7.10 Deregistration\nThis is the process of removing or cancelling a registered person from the VAT register.\nConditions for deregistration\n• When one ceases to make taxable supplies: This may occur when one changes \nthe nature of business from taxable to exempt supplies or through legal re-\ncategorisation of supplies, from taxable to exempt e.g. road construction works \nchanged from being taxable to exempt effective 1st July 2004. It can also be \nthrough winding up of business.Domestic Taxes76  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fourth Edition• Decline in turnover: This is a two-way test involving:\n1. Taxable turnover excluding VAT in the last 3 months no longer exceeds \n25% of the threshold (currently Shs. 37.5 million); and \n2. Taxable turnover excluding VAT in the last 12 months no longer exceeds \n75% of the threshold (currently Shs.112.5 million.\nThe Commissioner General may initiate deregistration under the following \ncircumstances:\n• When the taxpayer has no fixed place of abode or business   \npremises.\n• The taxpayer has no proper accounting/ business records for the business \ncarried on.\n• The taxpayer does not submit regular and reliable tax returns.\nThe taxpayer is not fit and proper in the opinion of the Commissioner General. \nNote:  In the case of a taxpayer registered voluntarily, deregistration can only be \neffected after 2 years from the date of registration.\nProcess of Deregistration\nApplication for deregistration arises in two ways\n• Upon application in writing by the taxpayer.\n• On the Commissioner General initiative if (s) he is satisfied that the taxpayer \nwas not required to apply for registration. This happens even if the taxpayer \ndoes not apply for it.\nEffective date of deregistration\nCancellation of registration takes effect at the end of the period (month) in which the \nde-registration decision is made e.g. if the decision to deregister is on 20th March 2019, \nderegistration will be effective on 31st March 2016.\nObligations at date of Deregistration\nWhere input tax has been claimed on goods in stock, including capital goods, the \nderegistered person is liable to VAT on the market value of such goods still in stock.Domestic Taxes77  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition7.7.11  Place of Supply\nFor a supply of goods to attract VAT, the supply must be made in Uganda. In the case \nof goods, the supply takes place where the goods are delivered or made available in \nUganda by the supplier or where it involves transportation, the goods are in Uganda \nwhen transportation commences in Uganda if the businesses supplier is in Uganda. In \nthe case of services, the supply takes place where the services are rendered.\n• However the following should be observed:\n• The supply of services is physically performed in Uganda.\n• The supply of services is in connection with unmovable property.\n• The supply of services are radio, television broadcasting services received at an \naddress in Uganda\n• The supply of electronic services in Uganda\n• Transfer, assignment or grant of a right to use a copyright, patent,   t r a d e-\nmark right in Uganda.\n• Telecommunication Services initiated by a person in Uganda but not a supplier of \ntelecommunication services for a person roaming temporarily in Uganda.\n7.7.12  Time of Supply\nThis refers to the date on which a supply is deemed to have taken place. The purpose \nof time of supply is to guide in determining the tax point. Tax point determines the \nVAT period in which output tax should be accounted for and credit for input tax be \ntaken into consideration. There are different provisions for the different circumstances \nas detailed below.\nSN Nature of supply Time of supply\n1Goods/Services for own \nuseDate on which goods or use services are first \napplied to own use\n2 Supplies by way of giftsGoods: Date when ownership passes to the \nrecipient\nServices: Date when the performance of \nservices is completed.\n3In case of rental \nagreements or periodic \npaymentsThe earlier of the following\n• Date when payment is due\n• Date of receipt of payment for each \nsuccessive payment\n4 Supply under cash basisDate when one received cash to account for \noutput or date when one pays cash to account \nfor input tax creditDomestic Taxes78  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fourth EditionSN Nature of supply Time of supply\n5 Ordinary (usual) supplyThe earlier of the following:\n• Invoice date.\n• Payment date.\n• Delivery date.\n6 Import of goods.For goods where import duty is payable, time \nof supply is the date when the duty is payable.\nWhere duty is not applicable, time of supply is \nthe date when goods enter into the country.\n7.7.13  Mixed Supplies\nUnder the VAT regime, supplies are categorized as either goods or services. There are \ntimes when a supply of a good involves a supply of a service; or vice versa. This type \nof supply where one is incidental to the other is referred to as a mixed supply.\n7.7.14 Computation of VAT\nComputation of VAT occurs at two levels:\n• VAT on a transaction i.e. a sale or a purchase\n• VAT payable or claimable by the taxpayer other way put is VAT collectable or \nrefundable by URA\nKey terms in VAT Computations\nTax rate: This is the percentage that is applied to the consideration for a transaction \nor taxable value, so as to determine the VAT amount. \nFor example: if the consideration or taxable value is Shs. 20, 000 and the VAT rate is \n18% (18/100), then VAT = 20,000 x18/100 = Shs. 3,600\nTax Fraction:  This refers to the ratio used to determine the amount of VAT where the \nconsideration is inclusive of VAT. The fraction is given by the formula:\n__r_____\nr + 100   where r is the VAT rate.\nIf the rate of tax (r) = 18% then the tax fraction = 18/ (18+100) = 18/118.\nFor example if the consideration (VAT inclusive) is Shs. 20,000, \nthen VAT = 20,000 × 18/118 = Shs. 3051.Domestic Taxes79  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition7.7.15  Apportionment of Input Tax Credit\nFor a taxable person that deals in both taxable and nontaxable supplies, input tax \ncredit is apportioned and claim only that part or percentage that relates to taxable \nsupplies/ sales using the formula:\nInput tax credit = A × B/C\nWhere:\nA is the total input tax in the period\nB is the total taxable sales in the period.\nC is total sales (both taxable + exempt).\n7.7.16  Standard Alternative Method (SAM)\nAnother method of apportionment called SAM is used when disadvantaged by the \nabove method. It is used when a taxable person obtains an approval from URA upon \napplication.\nUnder this method, input tax credit is determined as follows\n• Claim all input tax that is directly attributable to taxable supplies.\n• Disallow all input tax that is directly attributable to exempt supplies.\n• Apportion all input tax that is not directly attributable to either taxable or exempt \nsupplies using the above formula A × B/C.\n7.7.17 Non-Allowable Input Tax Credit\nThe general rule is that input tax incurred for business purposes should be allowed \nor credited to the taxpayer. However, the VAT Act disallows some input tax credits.\nThe following input tax credit is not allowed though incurred in respect to business \nactivities.\n• Passenger automobiles.  VAT incurred on purchase or importation \nof  passenger automobiles is not credited to the taxpayer. This includes  \npurchase of spare parts, repairs and maintenance of Passenger   \nautomobiles.\nException:  Input tax is allowed for purchase of passenger vehicles as stock for resale \nin a business activity and carrying on the business of tour operations.\n•  Entertainment .

Clearing agents are mandated \nto provide professional services of tax declaration to importers and exporters.\nThe Uganda Revenue Authority [URA] deals with licensed clearing firms represented \nby agents.  However, even though you must have a clearing agent assist in this \nfunction; do not be ignorant of your tax affairs.\nThe URA web portal is a useful resource with free tax material. When you log on, look \nout for the section ‘Information library’ and select the appropriate tax information \nrequired.  You can also find updated circulars and notifications and the exchange \nrates for tax purposes.\n3.3 Expectations of a clearing agent\nThere are many expectations, including:\n• Acquire an authorization letter from the owner of goods.\n• Obtain import/export documents (e.g. original import documents – bill  \n of lading, invoice or parking list or any other documents that relate  \nto the importation or exportation of goods).\n• Go to the bonded warehouse or the border stations where the goods   \nare and process transit or import documents for final clearance.\n• Provide, whenever required by customs administration, an authorization 3.0  |   Customs Clearing AgentsCustoms90  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition form from the firms or persons by whom he is employed to act as their  \n customs agent;\n• Represent a client in any matter related to customs;\n• Advise a client against non-compliance to customs laws.\n• Exercise due diligence to ascertain the correctness of any information   \nwhich he imparts to a client with reference to any customs operations.\n• Not withhold information relating to customs operations from a client   \nwho is entitled to such information.\n• Together with the importer, promptly pay government any duties,   \ntaxes or other debts and promptly account to his clients for any money   \nreceived for them from government.\nPlease note carefully , that importers should never hand over the payment obligation \nfor taxes exclusively to the clearing agents. Payments should either be made by \ncheque to URA or cash deposits to the bank.\nClearing agents are also expected to:\n• Not attempt to influence the conduct of any officer of customs in any   \nmatter pending before customs by the use of threat, false accusation,   \nduress or the offer of any special inducement or promise of advantage,   \nor of any gift.\n• Not procure or attempt to procure, directly or indirectly, information   \nfrom customs records or other government sources of any kind to   \nwhich access is not granted.\n• Inform the customs administration of any change of address before   \nsuch a change is effected.  \n3.4 Importance of a clearing agent \nAn agent, authorized by the owner to act on their behalf in writing, will be responsible \nfor preparing and presenting the declarations to Customs.

Such duties are distinct from \nspecific values that are based on specific measures for the goods such as numbers, \nweight, volume, area, capacity etc. \nThere can also be composite duties that are partly ad valorem and partly specific such \nas garments 3.5 per Kg or 35% whichever is higher. Customs tariff of Uganda levied \non different kinds of goods are published in the Uganda Gazette every financial year.\n6.4 Valuation of goods \nThere are six international methods for the valuation of imported goods stipulated \nin the World Trade Organization Agreement on Customs Valuation. They are applied \nin sequential order.\nThe primary method of valuation is the transaction value, which is the price actually \npaid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation. A \nnumber of conditions must be met to use the transaction valuation method and it \ncan involve deductions or additions such as commissions or royalties. 6.0  |  Customs valuation of imported goodsCustoms103  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth EditionWhen the transaction value cannot be used, one of the alternative methods will \nbe used to determine the customs value (methods of valuation) in sequential order\n• Identical goods value method  - Transaction value of Identical goods \npreviously cleared through Customs. Identical goods mean goods that are \nsame in all aspect except minor difference such as color, size. Must be of the \nsame brand and country of export.\n• Similar goods value method  - Transaction value of similar goods \npreviously cleared through Customs. Similar goods are goods that have like \ncharacteristics and are commercially interchangeable; if a customer doesn’t \nfind the exact product he/she wanted can choose an alternative e.g. Colgate \nand Close up. For goods to be regarded as similar, the brand must be of the \nsame reputation e.g. LG and Samsung; and from the same country of export.\n• Deductive value method – The basis for the Customs value is the price at \nwhich the greatest aggregate quantity of the imported goods is sold in \nUganda. Post importation costs and taxes are deducted to arrive at the \nCustoms value.\nThe deductible costs include:\nTaxes such as VAT, Import Duty, Excise Duty\nProfits and general expenses e.g. rent, labour etc; associated to the distribution \nand sale of the goods. As a Mark Up. \nPost importation Costs associated with the logistics and transportation of the \ngoods to the bonded warehouse.\n• Computed value method  – this is based on the direct cost of producing \nthe goods like raw materials, consumables, general expenses, other costs \nand profits relating to the production and sale of the imported goods. This \nmethod requires to get information for the country of production.\n• Fall-back value  – where no other methods re suitable, the customs value \ncan be derived based on one of the five methods reasonably adjusted. \nThe method is not used on its own but relies on the sequential flexible \ninterpretation of the 1st to the 5th method until the value of the goods is \ndetermined.\nCustoms will determine the value by considering the above valuation methods \nand any other relevant information.Customs104  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition6.5 Composition of Customs value\nThe customs value will include the following;\n• Cost of the goods free on board a transport vessel in the country of  \n export.\n• Freight charges up to the place of importation if the goods are   \n transported by road, Rail or Sea.\n• Loading, unloading, and handling charges associated with transport  \n of goods to the place of importation; and\n• The cost of insurance.\n6.6 Pre-shipment inspection\nCharges for pre-shipment inspection are normally incurred by the importer or by \ngovernment of the importing country. Such inspection may have been undertaken as \nper importing country’s policy or as the requirement per donor agency financing such \nimport or as importers own requirement. If such charges are paid for the importers \nbenefit, then they should be added to the customs value.\n6.7 Charges included in customs value\nEast African Community Customs Management Act (EACMA) requires that amounts \nfor certain charges and the value of certain goods and services, if not already included \nin the price paid or payable for the imported goods, must be added to the price paid \nor payable. These charges and v\\values are can include amounts for the following:\n• Commissions and brokerage\n• Cost of containers\n• Packing costs\n• Assists (goods or services provided by the buyer to the seller free   \n of charge or at reduced price to be used in the production of the    \n imported goods)\n• Royalties and license fees\n• Subsequent proceeds (a financial advantage to the vendor    \n resulting from resale, disposal or use of imported goods by the   \n purchaser)\n• Transportation costs and insurance costs to the place of direct   \n shipment to the partner state.Customs105  \nA Guide to Taxation in Uganda | Fifth Edition6.8 Packing costs  \nThe cost of packing overseas, such as labor and packages, is included in customs \nvalue of the goods.
